# TODO
Ironic I am writing notes about things I want to do with this note package. 

- save notes to a file or super lightweight DB based on directory
- get notes from cli args using the os.args package 
- delete notes based on some id 
- I want to be able to list out notes based on directory or global similar to atuin.
- clean up main and setup some helper functions etc.
- add some debug logging. 
- need to solve numbering as it will apppear via relative numbers in the TUI.
- select and edit existing note...
